        <p>
          You only could never just run your existing WebGL/Threejs app in it. It had to be rewritten.
          Pointer-events wouldn't work, controls, textures, GLTFs, etc. Worse, thanks to Safari you
          needed to maintain two forks of your app, one that runs in a worker and one that runs on the main thread as a
          fallback. Rt/offscreen attempts to fix that!
